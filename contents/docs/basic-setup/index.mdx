# Getting Started with DBLayer

Welcome to **DBLayer** – your toolkit for turning SQL queries into instant, secure REST APIs. In this guide, you’ll learn how to set up a database connection, organize your endpoints using workspaces, and publish your first custom API.

---

## 1. Create a Connection

The first step is to add a **Connection**. This is how DBLayer connects to your database.

> Currently, we support only **PostgreSQL** databases.

Your connection string should look like this:

```bash
postgres://username:password@host:port/database
```

If you don’t have a PostgreSQL database yet, you can use one of these free hosting providers:

## 2. Set Up a Workspace

A **Workspace** is like a project folder that helps you organize your API endpoints. Each workspace is linked to a single database connection.

### Key Features:

- Each workspace has a unique **slug**.
- All endpoints inside a workspace share the same database connection.

### Required Fields to Create a Workspace:

| Field           | Description                                                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**        | A descriptive name for your workspace.                              |
| **Connection**  | The database connection the workspace will use.                     |
| **Origins**     | Allowed frontend origins for CORS. Use this to secure your API.     |

---

## 3. Create Endpoints

Once your workspace is ready, you can start adding **Endpoints**.

Endpoints allow you to expose specific SQL queries as RESTful APIs. Each endpoint has its own path and can be configured to accept parameters and HTTP methods.

### Key Features:

- Each endpoint has a unique **slug** and its own API path.
- You can choose which HTTP methods to allow (`GET`, `POST`).

### Required Fields to Create an Endpoint:

| Field              | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**           | A readable name for your endpoint.                                  |
| **Allowed Methods**| Select which HTTP methods are supported (`GET` or `POST`).           |

Once created, your endpoint is instantly accessible and can be customized or tested as needed.

## What’s Next?

- Secure your endpoints with [Authentication](/docs/auth).
- Add [Rate Limiting](/docs/rate-limiting) to prevent abuse.
- Enable [Logging](/docs/logs) for monitoring and debugging.
- Start building your own workspace and endpoints in just a few minutes!
