# Troubleshooting Guide

If you run into issues while using dblayer, here are some common problems and solutions:

### 1. Database Connection Issues

**Problem:** Cannot connect to PostgreSQL database.
**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

- **Invalid connection string** — Make sure your string follows this format:
  `postgres://username:password@host:port/database`

- **Firewall/Network restrictions** — Ensure your database is publicly accessible or whitelist dblayer’s IP if required.

- **Wrong credentials** — Double-check username, password, host, and database name.

- **SSL required** — Some hosting providers (e.g., Render, Supabase) need `?sslmode=require` in the connection string.

### 2. Endpoint Not Working

**Problem:** Calling an API endpoint returns an error.
**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

- **SQL error** — Check if your SQL query runs correctly in your database client before using it in dblayer.

- **Wrong method** — Ensure you’re calling the endpoint with the correct HTTP method (GET vs POST).

- **Missing parameters** — If your query uses parameters, pass them properly in the request.

- **Unauthorized access** — Confirm if authentication/authorization is enabled for that endpoint.

### 3. Queries Returning No Data

**Problem:** API works, but response is empty.
**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

- **Empty table** — Verify your database actually has data.

- **Filtering issue** — Check if your `WHERE` clause or query parameters are too restrictive.

- **Schema mismatch** — Ensure you’re querying the correct schema (e.g., `public.users` vs `users`).

### 4. App Editor Issues

**Problem:** App is not updating or components aren’t showing data.
**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

- **Query not bound** — Make sure your component is linked to a valid SQL query or API endpoint.

- **Wrong data mapping** — Double-check that your table/label/input points to the correct field in the query response.

- **Unpublished changes** — Remember to click **Publish** after editing.

### 5. Publishing Problems

**Problem:** Endpoint/App not accessible after publishing.
**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

- **Private by default** — Apps are private unless you explicitly set them to public.

- **Wrong URL** — Verify your custom subdomain (e.g., `apple.dblayer.dev`).

- **Propagation delay** — Wait a few seconds and refresh after publishing.

### 6. Performance & Caching

**Problem:** API feels slow.
**Fixes:**

- Enable query caching for frequent queries.
- Optimize your SQL queries (indexes, limit results).
- Use pagination for large datasets.

### 7. General Debugging Tips

- Test your SQL queries directly in a PostgreSQL client (psql, Supabase, etc.) before using them in dblayer.
- Check console/network logs in your browser when testing endpoints.
- If all else fails, restart your workspace connection from the dashboard.
