# About dblayer

**TL;DR:** dblayer instantly generates APIs and enables you to build internal tools like dashboards and reports, **no backend code required**, directly on top of your database.

We currently offer **two core features**:

---

## Platform Structure

dblayer is divided into two parts: **API** and **App**.  
When you register, you can choose a custom subdomain, which becomes your App URL.  
For example, if you choose `apple` as your subdomain, your custom App URL will be:

```
apple.dblayer.dev
```

For managing APIs, you can use our central dashboard at:

```
dashboard.dblayer.dev
```

Currently, both the App and API are closely integrated. However, in the future, we plan to host all features on your custom subdomain so everything is unified under one URL—no extra navigation required.

## 1. API

The [Custom API](/docs/features/api) feature allows you to:

- Instantly generate REST APIs from your PostgreSQL database with minimal setup.
- Perform CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and pagination out of the box.
- Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization.
- Improve performance through query caching.
- Integrate effortlessly with frontend frameworks, mobile apps, and third-party services.

Whether you’re building a public API or an internal service, dblayer significantly reduces backend development time.

## 2. APP

The [Custom App](/docs/features/app) feature enables you to:

- Build interactive dashboards, admin panels, and reporting tools directly connected to your database.
- Use a drag-and-drop interface with pre-built components (tables, buttons, and more coming soon).
- Share your app securely with team members or external collaborators.
- Publish publicly or privately in seconds without worrying about infrastructure.

This is ideal for creating internal tools, quick prototypes, or data visualization—**all without writing backend code**.
