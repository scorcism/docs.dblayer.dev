## 1. Creating an App

To create your first app:

1. Click the **Create App** button from the dashboard.
2. Enter a **name** for your app.
3. Click **Create** (or press **Enter**).
4. You will be redirected to the **App Editor**.

---

## 2. Editing Your App

The **App Editor** is a drag-and-drop builder that allows you to design your appâ€™s interface and connect it to your database.

**Currently Supported Components:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**Table**](/docs/features/app/table) | Displays database query results in a tabular format. Supports sorting, filtering, and pagination. |
| [**Button**](/docs/features/app/button) | Triggers actions, such as running a query or calling an endpoint. |
| [**Text Input**](/docs/features/app/text-input) | Accepts user input that can be used in queries or filters. |
| [**Label**](/docs/features/app/label) | Displays static or dynamic text in your app. |

**Editing Features:**
- Drag and drop components onto the canvas.
- Resize and position components visually.
- Bind component data to SQL queries or API endpoints.
- Configure styles, labels, and default values.

## 3. Publishing the App

Once your app is ready, you can **publish** it:

- **Private** â€” Only you (and workspace members) can access it.
- **Public** â€” Anyone with the link can access it. *(Requires Pro access.)*

**Publishing Steps:**
1. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of the App Editor.
2. Choose your visibility settings (**Private** or **Public**).
3. Confirm to make the app live.

> After publishing, you can continue editing â€” updates are applied in real time once republished.

---

## 4. Best Practices

- **Reuse queries** across multiple components for consistency.
- **Test before publishing** to ensure all components behave as expected.
- Use **Labels** to guide users through the appâ€™s workflow.

---

## 5. Next Steps

With your first app published, you can:
- Explore [API Endpoints](/docs/api) for dynamic data.
- Build complete internal dashboards without writing extensive frontend code.
