## 1. Create a Connection

The first step is to **add a database connection** â€” this is how dblayer links to your database.

> Currently, dblayer supports only **PostgreSQL** databases.

A typical PostgreSQL connection string looks like this:

```bash
postgres://username:password@host:port/database
````

If you donâ€™t already have a PostgreSQL database, here are some **free hosting providers** you can use:

## 2. Set Up a Workspace

A **Workspace** acts like a project folder for your API endpoints.
Each workspace is linked to **a single database connection**.

**Workspace Highlights:**

* Unique **slug** for easy identification.
* All endpoints inside share the same database connection.
* Keeps your projects organized and manageable.

---

## 3. Create an Endpoint

Once your workspace is ready, you can create endpoints to expose SQL queries as REST APIs.

**Endpoint Capabilities:**

* Each endpoint has a **unique slug** and **custom API path**.
* Supports HTTP methods like `GET` and `POST`.
* Accepts query parameters for dynamic queries.

**Required Fields:**

| Field          | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**       | A readable, descriptive name for your endpoint.              |
| **API Method** | Choose supported HTTP methods (`GET` or `POST`).             |
| **SQL Query**  | The SQL statement that will run when the endpoint is called. |

Once created, your endpoint is **instantly live** and can be tested immediately.

---

## 4. Edit & Publish an Endpoint

After creating an endpoint, youâ€™ll be redirected to the **Editor**.
The editor includes multiple subpages where you can:

* Modify your SQL query.
* Adjust parameters.
* Test responses before publishing.

When youâ€™re ready, click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner to make your API live.

---

## 5. Next Steps

With your first API running, you can:

* Build **dashboards** or **internal tools** using your API.
